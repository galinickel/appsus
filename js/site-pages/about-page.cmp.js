        <p>The idea behind APPSUS is one of productivity- ever find yourself switching between the same two apps over, and over, and over again? </p>
        <p>As the need for enhanced productivity grew, the team at APPSUS decided to bring together our favorite things- functionality, a seamless user experience and a striking design.</p>
        <p>APPSUS was built by Almog Lemberg and Gali Nickel as a part of the <a href="https://www.coding-academy.org/" >Coding Academy</a>  fullstack bootcamp.</p>
